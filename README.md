# JSys website

The JSys website is statically built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and the amazing [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin.

Many thanks to the [Rescience journal](https://rescience.github.io) for making their website code open source, it made our life much easier and faster to set up JSys! 🔓😁🚀
