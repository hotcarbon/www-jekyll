## Travel

The Hay Barn is located at [94 Ranch View Road](https://goo.gl/maps/3mAGwHpGuE9196zh8), near the base of campus.
This [campus map](https://cowellhaybarn.ucsc.edu/resources/haybarn-guest%20parking%20map.pdf) shows the nearest bus stops and parking lots.

If you drive, UCSC will have parking attendants stationed at Lot 116, where attendees can purchase a parking pass for $10 from the attendant __between 7:30 and 9:30am__.
This parking lot is a ~5-minute walk from the Haybarn venue.

People who arrive __after 9:30__ can still park at the same cost, but they must visit the UCSC Transportation And Parking Services office to buy the permit.

There are also a limited number of ParkMobile spots in the area that people are welcome to use.
