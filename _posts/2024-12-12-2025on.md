After the success of its third edition, HotCarbon will be back in 2025 with a **1.5 day program!** (or even 2 days, if necessary).
Like in previous editions, the workshop will be collocated with OSDI and take place on July 10 and 11 in Cambridge, MA, USA.

We are delighted to have **Timo Hoenig** and **Abel Souza** as co-chairs of the 2025 program committee.  
Stay tuned for the CfP!
