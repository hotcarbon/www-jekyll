<p>After the success of its third edition, HotCarbon will be back in 2025 with a <strong>1.5 day program!</strong> (or even 2 days, if necessary).
Like in previous editions, the workshop will be collocated with OSDI and take place on July 10 and 11 in Cambridge, MA, USA.</p>

<p>We are delighted to have <strong>Timo Hoenig</strong> and <strong>Abel Souza</strong> as co-chairs of the 2025 program committee.<br />
Stay tuned for the CfP!</p>
