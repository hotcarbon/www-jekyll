  abstract: "Computing has a substantial environmental impact, with far-reaching consequences. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) alone contribute to 4% of global carbon emissions, equivalent to the aviation industry's carbon footprint. This impact is poised to increase as the demand for computing continues to surge, particularly at the edge and within massive hyperscale data centers.  
  Creating environmentally sustainable computing solutions presents unique challenges that go beyond energy efficiency optimization. It necessitates a holistic approach that considers various factors. For example, sustainable computing devices must account for the carbon emissions generated during the manufacturing process called embodied emissions, the influence of renewable energy sources that fluctuate by location and time on a system's operational emissions, and the intricate interplay between embodied and operational emissions. However, to enable sustainability-driven system design and optimization, we must first be able to quantify the carbon footprint of computing systems.  
  In this presentation, we will delve into recent breakthroughs and the research challenges we confront as we develop tools and methodologies to quantify the carbon footprint of computing systems across their lifetime, from hardware manufacturing to operational use. We will introduce new carbon accounting models, highlight their application to pertinent domains like AI to promote developing sustainable AI solutions, as well as the road ahead in enabling sustainability as a first order design tenet alongside performance, efficiency, and cost."
